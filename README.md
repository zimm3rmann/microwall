# microwall
###Summary
Microwall is an open-source Bitcoin micropayment paywall. Microwall works with hierarchical deterministic wallets to create a new receive address for each transaction so that a users can be confirmed, and content unlocked. The main benefit of this is that your private keys are not stored online and the payment goes directly from your userâ€™s wallet to your wallet. As micropayments are quite low risk, users are able to access content as soon as the transaction hits the Bitcoin network, without waiting for a confirmation.
